## Contents
**Mathematical and Algorithmic Implementation**
- [Image Compression Using Singular Value Decomposition](svd-in-image-compression/singular-value-decomposition-in-image-compression.pdf): A set of experiments that demonstrates the application of SVD for image compression and analysis. The project includes mathematical foundations, exploratory experiments, and visualizations.

**Number Theory and Abstract Algebra**
- [Cyclic Difference Sets](cyclic-difference-sets/cyclic-difference-sets.pdf): A study of cyclic difference sets derived from non-zero squares modulo integers, combining theoretical proofs and MATLAB simulations.

**Graph Theory and Combinatorics**
- [Chromatic Polynomials and Graph Coloring](chromatic-polynomials-and-graph-coloring/chromatic-polynomials-birkhoff-lewis-method.pdf): An exploration of chromatic polynomials in graph theory, utilizing Birkhoff-Lewis Reduction Algorithm for graph coloring problems. Includes derivations for paths, cycles, and complete graphs using combinatorial reasoning and mathematical induction.  

**Analysis of Iterative Processes**
- [Convergence and Divergence in Linear Iteration Sequences](iteration-sequence-analysis/convergence-divergence-in-linear-iteration-sequences.pdf): An algebraic and geometric analysis of convergence and divergence behavior in linear iteration sequences. Visualizes iterative processes using cobweb diagrams. Investigates the role of parameters, initial value, conditions for fixed points, oscillatory behaviors, and exponential divergence.
